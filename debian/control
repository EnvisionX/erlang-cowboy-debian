Description: Small, fast, modular HTTP server written in Erlang.
 Cowboy is a small, fast and modular HTTP server written in Erlang.
 .
 Cowboy aims to provide a complete HTTP stack in a small code base.
 It is optimized for low latency and low memory usage, in part
 because it uses binary strings.
 .
 Cowboy provides routing capabilities, selectively dispatching
 requests to handlers written in Erlang.
 .
 Because it uses Ranch for managing connections, Cowboy can easily
 be embedded in any other application.
 .
 No parameterized module. No process dictionary. Clean Erlang code.
